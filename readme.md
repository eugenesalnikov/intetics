The test task:
(Please, use only standard PHP libraries You shouldn't use PHP Frameworks)
The application must be developed using MVC
The browser has a form with a single textarea field
The user can enter anything he wants into the form
After submitting the form, the data should be written to the mysql database under a unique identifier.
After the data is written to the database, the same data must be selected and displayed in the browser in exactly the same form as entered by the user.
The data must be sent by email and sent as an SMS (only the classes need to be implemented), the sending itself is not necessary
Be sure to provide protection from SQL injection, XSS, CSRF
Please, use GitHub to show your test
The solution should take about 30-40 minutes, 5-6 files. The focus should be on the simplicity of the code and its basic security
